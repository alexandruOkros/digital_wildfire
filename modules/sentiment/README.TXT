Dear all,

Finally I was subject to Python. 
Python is 100 times better easier than JavaScript. I worked on AlchemyAPI with JavaScript for about one week, and was still not able to figure out how to update a variable inside the callback function (say if we want to store the information we get form the AlchemyAPI stream to a local variable). But I did it in 5 minutes using Python. 

Python seems to be easier to analysis the data, so I suggest using Python in the backend and JavaScript in the frontend. 

Regards,

Tony
