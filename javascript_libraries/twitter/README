Tweet.js contains the definition of a Tweet. From the Twitter API we receive 
an Tweet object that holds the data, but doesn't have any methods defined.

Twitter.js is the interface between our application and the Twitter API. Because
it usese node.js, it first needs to be linked in Twitter_compiled.js and then 
used.
