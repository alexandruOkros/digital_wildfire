Twitter.js is the interface between our application and the Twitter API. Because
it usese node.js, it first needs to be linked in Twitter_compiled.js and then 
used.
To search for tweets use: Twitter.searchTweets (this only works for a maximum of
100 returned tweets; will implement in the future a methods which will return more)
To get the trending topics use: Twitter.getTrends
To import data from our supervisers (from the folder "Twitter 23 Feb 2016") use:
Twitter.getImportedData - make sure you include the twitter/data/imported_data.js.
The problem is that these tweets have significantly fewer signals than tweets 
imported from Twitter.


Tweet.js contains the definition of a Tweet. Read that to see what is available
for a tweet.

User.js contains the definition of a User. Each tweet contains an object of type
User representing the user that posted that tweet.

Trend.js contains the definition of a Trend object. An object of this type is 
returned when accessing the trending page from Twitter.
